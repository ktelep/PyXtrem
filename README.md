# PyXtrem
PyXtrem is a library comprising of python modules that simplifies the consumption of XtremIO REST API.

## Description
PyXtrem is a library comprising of python modules that simplifies the consumption of XtremIO REST API. The library comprises of 
- xtremHardwareLib.py – Functions wrapping REST queries to XtremIO that get details of hardware aspects of XtremIO cluster
- xtremOperationsLib.py – Functions wrapping REST queries to XtremIO that can create, delete and get details of XtremIO objects objects like volumes, snapshot, initiators and initiator groups
- xtremXenvLib.py – Functions wrapping REST query to get details of X environment. There are utility functions that leverage REST query in getting performance stats on single volume
- xtremXmsLib.py – Functions wrapping REST query that get details of XMS. It also has utility functions that leverage REST query in performance stats at the scope of entire XtremIO cluster

Users can automate workflows related to XtremIO management functions such as adding/deleting an XtremIO volume, initiator or initiator group, consistency groups, creating snapshots on volumes or consistency groups, refreshing a snapshot and many more.

## Installation
Download the python files and copy in the them in your working directory.

## Usage Instructions
In your python program that is meant to automate certain set of tasks for XtremiO, just import the necessary or all the python modules and start invoking functions defined in these. Typically, you would need to pass XtremIO IP address, username and password and other parameters
```
import xtremXenvLib
import xtremXmsLib
import xtremOperationsLib
import xtremHardwareLib

xtremOperationsLib.createVolume(""1.1.1.1","username","password","TEST-Volume","500g")
xtremOperationsLib.getVolumeDetails("1.1.1.1","username","password","TEST-Volume")
xtremOperationsLib.createSnapshot("1.1.1.1","username","password",["Test-Volume"])

xtremXmsLib.getXms("1.1.1.1","username","password")

xtremXenvLib.getXenvs("1.1.1.1","username","password")

xtremHardwareLib.getXbricks("1.1.1.1","username","password")
```

There is an object based API wrapper also included, currently supporting the gathering of array information at this time.   Physical and logical devices are represented as XtremObjects.  The details() function returns a dict containing all of the detailed information returned from the array for that particular object.

```
array = XtremIO("1.1.1.1","username","password")

# Get a list of clusters in the XMS, and set the active one to the first one
clusters = array.get_clusters()
array.set_cluster(clusters[0])

# Get a list of the bricks in the active cluster
bricks = array.get_xbricks()
for brick in bricks:
    print brick.details()

```



## Future
Currently, wrapper functions for critical activities related to volumes, consistency groups, snapshots, are added. In future, wrapper functions will be added for 
- ISCSI initiators
- DPG
- Schedulers
- Notifiers (SYR, SNMP, SYSLOG))
